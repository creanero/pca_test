# Principal Component Analysis Demonstration
Basic implementation of Principal Component Analysis on a step-by-step process.  

There are many better, more efficient implementations of PCA out there.  This one is designed to allow students to go through it step-by-step and see the processes involved, rather than being optimised for speed and efficiency
